Attribute Set is
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

Initial FDs are
A,B -> C
B -> D
C -> A

 "Canonical Cover" of FDs set is
A,B -> C
B -> D
C -> A

 "Candidate Keys" of Universal Relation are
(['A', 'B'], ['B', 'C'])

On converting
['A', 'B', 'C'] to (['A', 'C'], ['B', 'C'])
BCNF is not FD preserving, these FDs are violated
A,B -> C

 "2NF" Decomposition of Universal Relation is
(['A', 'B', 'C'], ['B', 'D'])

 3NF Decomposition of Universal Relation is
(['A', 'B', 'C'], ['B', 'D'])

 "BCNF" Decomposition of Universal Relation is
(['A', 'C'], ['B', 'C'], ['B', 'D'])
